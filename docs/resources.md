### Developer Portal

The [Blizzard Battle.net Developer Portal](https://develop.battle.net/) has lots of useful information.

- Read the [Getting Started](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/guides/getting-started) guide to create a client and generate your secret.
- The [World of Warcraft](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/world-of-warcraft) page provides general information about the APIs for World of Warcraft.
There are other pages for other Blizzard games.
- The [Game Data APIs](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/world-of-warcraft/game-data-apis) and [Profile APIs](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/world-of-warcraft/profile-apis) pages let you use your OAuth client credentials to test API calls and inspect the results.
These are great tools for debugging issues.

### API Bug Report

Getting errors? Think you found a bug?
